Features

- JavaScript blocking to stop cursors, selection, and right-click.
- Keyword cloaking to hide sensitive markers in DOM and source.
- Noise injection to add harmless DOM items and random attributes.
- Optional AES-256 content encryption using CryptoJS.
- Small, vanilla JavaScript with no framework required.
- WordPress plugin wrapper for easy install.
- Configurable rules and allowlist for search engines and bots.
- Runtime hooks for custom integration and logging.

Why use this

- Reduce content scraping and mass copy.
- Obscure internal labels and data points to slow automated parsers.
- Add a second layer of protection beyond standard server rules.
- Encrypt critical payloads that must run client-side.
- Keep the code small and fast so it does not hurt page speed.

How it protects content

1. JS blocking
   - The script stops text selection, drag, and context menu. It blocks direct DOM inspection in common flows.
2. Keyword cloaking
   - The script swaps or masks key words or phrases in the DOM. It stores masked values in attributes and restores them at render time.
3. Noise injection
   - The script adds DOM nodes and attributes that look like real content. Scrapers follow noise and waste resources.
4. Full encryption (optional)
   - For high-value pages, the script encrypts selected blocks with AES-256. The client decrypts them at runtime with a transient key.
5. Allowlist and rules
   - You can let search bots or trusted agents bypass protection via rules and signatures.

Install

- Use the Releases page to get packaged builds:
  https://github.com/im-yru/init-content-protector/releases ‚Äî the release file must be downloaded and executed.
- The package contains:
  - dist/init-content-protector.min.js
  - wp-plugin/init-content-protector.zip
  - docs and examples

If the Releases link does not work, check the "Releases" section of this repository for builds and archives.

Quick start ‚Äî Vanilla JavaScript

1. Add the script to your page header or before closing body.

```html
<script src="/path/to/init-content-protector.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const protector = new ICP({
    mode: "hybrid",         // block, cloaking, hybrid, encrypt
    allowlist: ["Googlebot"],
    keywords: ["price", "email"],
    injectNoise: true,
    encryption: {
      enabled: false,
      key: null            // or set per-page key
    }
  });

  protector.init();
</script>
```

2. Wrap content you want protected

```html
<article data-icp-protect="true">
  <h1>Premium Article</h1>
  <p data-icp-key="email">contact@example.com</p>
</article>
```

3. The script runs at DOM ready. It cloaks keywords, blocks selection, and injects noise. If encryption is enabled, it decrypts blocks in memory once the key is provided.

WordPress plugin

- Locate the WP plugin zip in Releases.
- Upload via the WP admin plugins page or place the `init-content-protector` folder into `wp-content/plugins/`.
- Activate the plugin.
- Configure under Settings ‚Üí Init Content Protector.

Plugin features

- Per-post protection toggle.
- Global allowlist for bots.
- Per-role exclusion.
- Auto-encrypt selected blocks with a post meta key.
- Shortcode support: [icp_protect]...[/icp_protect]

Config options

- mode: "block" | "cloak" | "hybrid" | "encrypt"
- allowlist: array of strings or regexes
- keywords: array of strings or regexes
- injectNoise: boolean
- noiseDensity: number (0-1)
- encryption.enabled: boolean
- encryption.key: string | null
- encryption.algorithm: "AES-256-CBC" (default)
- hooks: { onProtect, onRestore, onDecrypt }

Example config

```js
{
  mode: "encrypt",
  allowlist: ["Googlebot", /^bingbot/],
  keywords: ["email", "price", "serial"],
  injectNoise: true,
  noiseDensity: 0.25,
  encryption: {
    enabled: true,
    key: "per-page-key-string"
  },
  hooks: {
    onProtect: (node) => { /* custom log */ },
    onDecrypt: (node) => { /* audit */ }
  }
}
```

API reference

- Constructor: new ICP(config)
  - Returns an instance with methods below.

- protector.init()
  - Start protection. Attach handlers and run transforms.

- protector.protectNode(node)
  - Protect a single DOM node on demand.

- protector.unprotectNode(node)
  - Restore original node content.

- protector.encryptNode(node, key)
  - Encrypt DOM node content with AES-256.

- protector.decryptNode(node, key)
  - Decrypt DOM node content.

- protector.addKeyword(word)
  - Add a keyword to cloaking list.

- protector.removeKeyword(word)
  - Remove from cloaking list.

- protector.setAllowlist(list)
  - Replace allowlist.

Encryption notes

- The library uses CryptoJS for AES-256. The encrypted payload stores IV and ciphertext in base64.
- Use a short-lived key for pages that decrypt in the browser.
- Avoid exposing long-term private keys in client code.
- Provide server-side rotation and per-page salts for better protection.

Examples

1. Simple keyword cloaking

```js
const p = new ICP({ mode: "cloak", keywords: ["email"] });
p.init();
```

2. AES-256 protected block

```html
<div id="secret" data-icp-protect="true" data-icp-encrypted="true">
  U2FsdGVkX19...  <!-- base64 cipher -->
</div>

<script>
  const p = new ICP({ encryption: { enabled: true } });
  p.init();
  // Server provides one-time key via secure endpoint
  fetch("/api/one-time-key")
    .then(r => r.text())
    .then(key => p.decryptNode(document.getElementById("secret"), key));
</script>
```

3. WordPress shortcode

Use shortcode to mark content for protection:

[icp_protect mode="encrypt" key="post-key"]Hidden content here[/icp_protect]

Best practices

- Keep critical keys off public code.
- Combine server-side bot rules with client-side protection.
- Use allowlist rules to avoid SEO impact.
- Use noise injection sparingly to avoid DOM bloat.
- Test the site with major crawlers after enabling protection.

Performance

- The script uses batched DOM operations.
- Noise injection has a density control to limit nodes added per second.
- Encryption runs in Web Worker if available to avoid main thread blocking.

Security model

- This tool raises the cost for automated scraping.
- It does not replace server-side access controls or DRM.
- Use it as part of a layered defense with rate limits, CAPTCHAs, and server rules.

Troubleshooting

- If content does not decrypt, check the console for decryption errors.
- If a crawler fails to index protected pages, add it to the allowlist.
- If layout shifts appear, lower noiseDensity and check CSS selectors.
